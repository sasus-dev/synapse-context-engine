# 🕰️ Legacy Demos

This folder contains early proof-of-concept demos built as Claude Artifacts. These were used for rapid prototyping and concept validation during initial development.

## ⚠️ Status: Archived

These demos are **no longer maintained** and may not reflect the current implementation. They're preserved for historical reference and to show the project's evolution.

## 📂 Files

### `sce_demo.tsx`
**Created:** November 2025 
**Purpose:** Initial spreading activation visualization  
**Status:** Superseded by full application

Basic demonstration of:
- Hypergraph structure
- Energy propagation
- Simple node activation

### `sce_demo_with_brain_behavior.tsx`
**Created:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Enhanced demo with Hebbian learning  
**Status:** Superseded by full application

Added features:
- Hebbian weight updates
- Visual connection strengthening
- Basic temporal dynamics

## 🚀 Current Implementation

For the latest working version, see:
- **Web App:** `npm run dev` (runs full React application)
- **Desktop App:** `npm run tauri dev` (native desktop version)
- **Documentation:** [Quick Start Guide](../docs/guides/Quick-Start-Tutorial.md)

## 🎯 Why Keep These?

1. **Historical context** - Shows initial design decisions
2. **Learning resource** - Simple, self-contained examples
3. **Quick testing** - Can still be run in Claude Artifacts for instant demos
4. **Evolution tracking** - See how the architecture matured

## 💡 Using These Demos

If you want to try these legacy demos:

1. Copy the entire `.tsx` file
2. Open [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
3. Paste into a conversation
4. Ask Claude to "create an artifact with this code"
5. Interact with the visualization

**Note:** These use simplified logic and may have bugs. For accurate behavior, use the main application.

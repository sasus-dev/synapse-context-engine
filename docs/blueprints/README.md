# SCE Blueprints

This folder contains the initial conceptual documents that guided SCE's development.

## ⚠️ Important Note

These are **design blueprints**, not academic papers. They represent early thinking and architectural explorations. The actual implementation has evolved significantly from these initial concepts.

### Documents

- **sce_initial_concept.pdf** (Dec 2025) - Original architecture proposal
  - Note: The math and implementation have been refined during development
  - Treat this as historical context, not current specification
  - See [architecture notes](../notes/) for current thinking
